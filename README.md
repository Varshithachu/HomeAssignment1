**Tensor Reshaping and Operations**
##Description
This demonstrates basic tensor operations using TensorFlow. It includes creating a random tensor, reshaping it, transposing it, and performing broadcasting operations. The code is designed to help users understand how to manipulate tensors in TensorFlow.
##Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have TensorFlow installed. You can install it using pip:
bash
pip install tensorflow
##Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Varshithachu/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Tensor_Reshaping_and_operations.ipynb
##Code Overview
Create a Random Tensor: A random tensor of shape (4, 6) is created.
Find Rank and Shape: The rank and shape of the tensor are determined.
Reshape and Transpose: The tensor is reshaped to (2, 3, 4) and then transposed to (3, 2, 4).
Broadcasting: A smaller tensor of shape (1, 4) is broadcasted to match the larger tensor, and they are added together.

##how broadcasting works in TensorFlow
Broadcasting in TensorFlow allows element-wise operations on tensors of different shapes by automatically expanding their dimensions to match each other. This concept is similar to NumPy broadcasting and helps perform operations without explicitly reshaping tensors.When performing operations like addition, multiplication, or other element-wise operations between tensors of different shapes, TensorFlow automatically expands the smaller tensor to match the shape of the larger tensor based on certain rules.

**##Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning**
##Description
This  demonstrates the computation and comparison of two common loss functions used in machine learning: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE). The code also explores how small perturbations in model predictions affect these loss values and visualizes the results.
##Installation
To run this notebook, you need to have TensorFlow and Matplotlib installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
##Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Varshithachu/your-repo.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-repo
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook Loss_Functions_&_Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb
##Code Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
Define True Values and Predictions: True labels (y_true) and model predictions (y_pred) are defined.
Compute Losses: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) losses are computed using TensorFlow's built-in loss functions.
Perturb Predictions: Small perturbations are applied to the predictions, and new loss values are computed.
Visualize Losses: The initial and perturbed loss values are plotted to compare the behavior of MSE and CCE.

**# Train a Model with Different Optimizers**
##Description
This repository  demonstrates how to train a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset using two different optimizers: **Adam** and **SGD**. The script compares the performance of these optimizers by plotting their validation accuracy over epochs.
#Requirements
To run this code, you need the following Python libraries installed:
- **TensorFlow**: A powerful library for machine learning and deep learning.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
##Installation
You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
##Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Run the script using Python:
python train_model.py
##Code Overview
The script performs the following steps:
Load and Normalize Data: The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to the range [0, 1].
Define the Model: A simple neural network with one hidden layer is defined using Keras.
Train the Model: The model is trained using both Adam and SGD optimizers. The training process is logged, and the validation accuracy is recorded.
Plot Results: The validation accuracy for both optimizers is plotted over the training epochs.

**##Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard**
##Description
This repository  demonstrates how to train a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The training process is logged using TensorBoard, allowing you to visualize metrics such as accuracy and loss over time.
#Requirements:
To run this code, you need the following Python libraries installed:
**TensorFlow**: A powerful library for machine learning and deep learning.
**NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python.
**Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
##Installation
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib

##Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
Run the script using Python:
python train_neural_network.py

##Code Overview
The script performs the following steps:
Load and Preprocess Data: The MNIST dataset is loaded and normalized to the range [0, 1].
Define the Model: A simple neural network with one hidden layer is defined using Keras.
Compile the Model: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, and accuracy as the metric.
Train the Model: The model is trained for 5 epochs, and the training process is logged using TensorBoard.
Launch TensorBoard: Instructions are provided to launch TensorBoard and visualize the training metrics.
#Results
The script trains the model for 5 epochs and logs the training process using TensorBoard. After training, you can launch TensorBoard to visualize metrics such as accuracy and loss over time.
To launch TensorBoard, run the following command in your terminal:
tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit/20250214-174408

#Patterns observed in the training and validation accuracy curves are the training accuracy increases steadily while the validation accuracy may plateau or fluctuate and if the gap between training and validation accuracy grows significantly, it may indicate overfitting.

#TensorBoard used to detect overfitting by comparing training and validation loss curves if validation loss starts increasing while training loss decreases, overfitting is occurring.A large gap between training and validation accuracy suggests the model is memorizing training data instead of generalizing.

#The effects of increasing the number of epochs are initially, performance improves as the model learns patterns and neyond a certain point, the validation accuracy may degrade while training accuracy continues increasing, indicating overfitting
